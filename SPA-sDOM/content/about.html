    <h2>About This Application</h2>
    <p>This is a mobile-first Single Page Application designed for fast navigation and persistent content states.</p>
    <p>It leverages a "Single DOM" architecture, where all page content is loaded once into the main `index.html` file, and navigation between pages is achieved by simply toggling the visibility of specific content sections.</p>
    <p>This approach ensures instant page transitions and allows complex elements like embedded Twitch chat iframes to retain their state without reloading.</p>
